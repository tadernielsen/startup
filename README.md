# Game Development Website (Name Undecided)

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application serves as both a developer log and a place where I can feature games I have created. People can go on the application and read the devlogs and download games that I have created and released onto their computer. The site can also double as a portfolio where I can send employers to look at my works.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Whenever I am making a game or some other project, it would be nice to have somewhere to put it for people to easily see it. This application is designed to be a hub for games that I create and release onto the internet. It is also designed to have a devlog where I can write about stuff that I am doing and also announce games on. Users will be able to log into the website and read the devlogs and like both posts or games. They will also be able to go to the games page and install my games (or redirect to a website where they can install it). I will also be able to log in to the site and be able to add new posts or create a new page for a game.
