# TN-Games (Game Development Website)

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application serves as both a developer log and a place where I can feature games I have created. People can go on the application and read the devlogs and download games that I have created and released onto their computer. The site can also double as a portfolio where I can send employers to look at my works.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Whenever I am making a game or some other project, it would be nice to have somewhere to put it for people to easily see it. This application is designed to be a hub for games that I create and release onto the internet. It is also designed to have a devlog where I can write about stuff that I am doing and also announce games on. Users will be able to log into the website and read the devlogs and like both posts or games. They will also be able to go to the games page and install my games (or redirect to a website where they can install it). I will also be able to log in to the site and be able to add new posts or create a new page for a game.

- Seprate, secure ***Developer Login Page*** so I can login with the ability to add posts
- Ability for me (The developer) to create new devlog posts and game pages without having to mess with the code

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - The basic structure for the website. Uses 5 HTML pages. Pages are, Home, Devlog, Games, User Login, and Developer Login. Uses Hyperlinks to connect all of the pages together.
- **CSS** - Create the style for the website. Such as where all the boxes goes and the size of images.
- **React** - Provides login, post, applying likes/favorites, display likes/favorites, game install, and backend endpoint calls. Reacts to user actions on site.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - retrieving game files
    - retrieving post info
    - submitting likes or favorites
    - submitting new posts or games
    - displaying a random geek joke from https://geek-jokes.sameerkumar.website/api?format=json
- **DB/Login** - Stores game files and post data, devlog post data, and likes/favorites in database. Also stores user and developer data securely in the database. Users must be authenticated to like or favorite posts, but not to install games.
- **WebSocket** - Posts are brodcast to other users when submitted by the Developer. Likes and favorites are also brodcasted when a user presses the button
